## Scale Reading and Uncertainty
- Some tubes/beakers don't have precise markings, some do
- Uncertainty: Limit of precision of the reading (based on ability to guess the final digit)
	- Exists in measured quantities not in counted quantities
		- Counted quantities are exact numbers, so there is no confusion
- Certain digits
	- Have at least one uncertain digit in calculation
	- Arrow is 8.52mm

## Significant Figures
- Significant Figures:
	- Digits in a measurement that have meaning relative to the equipment being used
- Digits with meaning:
	- Digits that can be known precisely plus a last digit that must be estimated
- How to determine which figures are significant in a given number
	- All non-zero digits (1-9) are significant
	- The zeros in a number are not always significant, it depends on their position in the number
		- There are a standard set of rules for figuring out whether or not zeros are significant
- Rules for zeros
	- Place holder zeros don't count
		- These are the ones that disappear when you write number in scientific notation
	- Zeros between nonzero digits are significant
		- 1005
	- Zeros at the beginning are never significant
		- 0.02
	- Zeros at the end of a number are significant if the number contains a decimal point
		- 0.02000, 3.0

Practice
- $400.0g$ = 4 sig figs
- $4000g$ = 1 sigfig
- $0.4000g$ = 4 sig figs
- $0.04g$ = 1 sig fig
