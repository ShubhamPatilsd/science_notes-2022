Aff case

Contention 1: US unipolarity
- Great power needed
- Overtake number #1 rank US economy
- China already gaining economic superiority
- China economic leverage is powerful tool
- US economy could lose more than $1 trillion
- Other countries affected
- 60 members of UN applauded China's human rights thingy
- China = bad political system expanded if China gains power
- Unipoloarity what is this meaning
- Putin does not wanna do the US
Contention 2: appeastment does not work
- RUssia cant be a NATO partner anymore
- Little confidence in Russia and USA to do the right thing
- China and US competition is intense
	- China and US failed to help each other in COVID-19
- RUssia and China going unchallenged is a bad idea
- In WW2, appeastment = loss of land because HItler
- Both China and Russia + allies could bring down the USA



Neg rebuttal
- not appeasing anything
	- Avoiding and trying to cooperate
		- China wants to work together
- We both have power to fight against each other
- Tarrifs against China
	- Both raised and we hurt each other
- Avoid being antagonizingin towards China and cooperate

Response:
- China is not going to cooperate, they want power if we give in
	- They didnt cooperte for a reason in COVID, to prove that they are better and independent
- We saw this with the Belton Road Initiative where they acted cooperative with country and  just dominated with trade ports
	- This shows how China is greedy
- If we have the power against China, we are going to go back to Great Power Competition the status quo
