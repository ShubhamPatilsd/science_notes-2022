5 tenets
1) **Particle volume is negligible** (so small it doesn't matter. Distance between particles very large compared to particle size)
2) Constant motion
3) Collisions are elastic (no energy loss)
4) No intermolecular forces (only exist as gases, not allowed to change phase)
5) Average kinetic energy is directly proportional to absolute temp (K)C
