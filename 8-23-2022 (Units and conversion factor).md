# 8-23-2022 Notes
-   Each quantity you write should have a:Â 
-   Number, unit, label
-   Conversions
-   Equivalence statements show two quantities that are equal ($1mL=1 cm^3$)
-   Conversion factors are ratios made from equivalence statement $1=(\frac{1mL} {1cm^3}), 1=\frac{1cm^3} {1mL}$
-   Convert by multiplying a unit by a conversion factor that cancels the original unit
-  $50mL * H_{2}O * \frac{1cm^3}{1mL} = 50cm^3 * H_{2}0$
-   100cm = 1m, 1 = 1m/100cm
    
-   Problems:
    

    

1.  5.2cm to mm = 52mm
    
2.  0.049kg to g = 49g
    
3.  1.6mL in microliters = 1,600,000 microliters
    
4.  0.0025g in micrograms = 2500 micrograms
    
5.  0.020 kg to milligrams = 20000mg
